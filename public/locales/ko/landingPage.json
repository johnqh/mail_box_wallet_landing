        "answer": "Signic ID combines a secure crypto wallet with a decentralized identity layer. Unlike regular wallets that only store assets, we provide a complete identity solution that lets you prove who you are, manage credentials, and authenticate across Web3 - all while maintaining full control of your data."

      "security": {
        "question": "How is my data secured?",
        "answer": "Your private keys are encrypted locally and never leave your device. We use industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and support hardware wallet integration for additional security. Your identity data is stored on decentralized networks, not on our servers."
      },
      "chains": {
        "question": "Which blockchains are supported?",
        "answer": "We support Ethereum, Solana, and all major EVM-compatible chains including Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and more. Our multi-chain architecture lets you manage assets across all networks from a single interface."
      },
      "recovery": {
        "question": "Can I recover my identity if I lose access?",
        "answer": "Yes. We support multiple recovery options including seed phrase backup, social recovery through trusted contacts, and hardware wallet backup. Your identity is linked to your cryptographic keys, so as long as you can recover your keys, you can recover your identity."
      },
      "cost": {
        "question": "Is there a cost to use the service?",
        "answer": "The basic wallet and identity features are free to use. Some advanced features like premium naming services or enterprise integrations may have associated costs. Network transaction fees (gas) apply when interacting with blockchains."
